# Castellan

> Castellan is a local sysadmin bot, designed to perform repetitive tasks based on a variety of triggers, events, and simple conditions.

## Goals

Ultimately, the point of Castellan is to take on various day-to-day or repetitive tasks that are sufficiently numerous and boring that you'd rather write up a small YAML spec file rather than continuing to do it yourself.
