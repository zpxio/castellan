## Is and Isn't

* **DOES:** Respond to streams of local operating system events via registered monitors using combinations of built-in routines and shell commands.
* **DOESN'T:** Act as a centralized network or cluster manager.

While it might not be difficult to generate events from local network activity, Castellan isn't intended to be used to orchestrate actions across multiple hosts. Maybe someday I'll remove this section and announce multi-host support, but for now, the expectation is that events are generated by listen-only monitors and take actions on the Castellan host. 

Obviously, some exceptions exist, including things like actions that send emails or integrate with Slack. While the pedantic will argue those are external actions, it's still within the spirit of the design.

#### Event Volume

* **DOES:** Handle events using an event queue to handle flow and manage event ordering.
* **DOESN'T:** Handle constant-high event volumes. 

Castellan isn't intended to be a high volume event system. This is about automating repetitive tasks. While performance is always a goal, if you need to trigger ten actions a second every hour, then you want a real streaming event processor rather than a event-based system bot.
